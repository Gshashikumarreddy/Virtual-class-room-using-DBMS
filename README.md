# Virtual-class-room-using-DBMS
The Virtual Classroom Project is a small Java-SQL based project. We plan to provide a 
platform for faculty and students to interact and view resources as part of this project. 
The primary problem is that many students have difficulties because most universities are 
located outside of town.visit the universities and take part in the courses. A major 
component of the job is virtual learning, which allows students to participate from any 
location via the internet. These days, a lot of courses are available online, and you can pay 
a certain amount to access them. This Java project follows the same process, with the user 
logging in to access resources provided by their faculty and interacting with them.
